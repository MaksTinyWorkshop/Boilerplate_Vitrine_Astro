### Create your display campaign

Whether you work with traditional billboards or DOOH networks, an impactful campaign still relies on a structured approach. We combine strategy, creativity, and logistics so your brand message sticks with your audience.

### Connect the media player

Our technician installs the device, plugs the screen via HDMI, and secures the network connection (Wi-Fi or Ethernet) to guarantee continuous broadcasting. You focus on the content; we handle the technical side.

Once visuals and media planning are approved, we deploy your content across every selected channel. Scheduling, monitoring, and updates are managed for you to maximise results.
